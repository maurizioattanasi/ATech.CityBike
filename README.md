# Tech.CityBike
Sample .NET CRUD Project

## Note for me

In the **Application** project add a folder per feature (slice) and in that folder add a folder named interface. In this latest folder there will be the customization of the repository interface of the entity.

In the **Infrastructure** project the same folder structure will be implemented
